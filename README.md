# hackathon

Participated in a hackathon where the goal was to create a text adventure. 

It's Monday morning at the office. The goal: To procrastinate as much as possible before you get to go home.
The clock starts at T-minus 8 hours (or 480 min)

Tasks:
    There are two types of tasks: Productive tasks and Wasteful Tasks.
    Tasks are selected at random. 
    Both types add to the clock, but wasteful tasks also add to a seperate counter. Once you hit 8 hours, you get to go home!!     
    Wastefulness is then totaled. Whoever wasted the most time is the victor.

Coffee: 
    Making coffee wastes time! However, drinking coffee makes you more productive! 
    You get to waste 20 minutes everytime you make coffee, but it makes you 5 minutes more productive at every subsequent task.

Classes: 
    There are three classes: Engineer, Manager, and Newb. 
    Engineers are faster at certain tasks, while Managers are faster at others. 
    Newbs are terrible at everything.

Items: 
    Certain items give you bonus modifiers!!
    Stapler:
    Sticky Notes:
    Highlighter:

User input: 
    You get to name your character! 
    You get to choose your item!!

To Do: 
- Add user input for character class selection 
- Make it so you can choose how many players
- Make it so coffee causes you to be exponentially faster at tasks.
